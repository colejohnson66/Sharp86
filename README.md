# Sharp86

Sharp86 is an x86-64 emulator written in C#. It is currently a work in progress
and will probably never be finished. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Sharp86 is an Emulator

Sharp86 is an emulator, not a virtual machine. In a similar vein to
[Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/), _all_ instructions are decoded and
individually executed one by one, with no JIT.
